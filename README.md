# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

In this project I will make an automatic job application AI, that will help people with no jobs apply to jobs automatically with the help of AI. The AI will analyze the CV of the person and then find jobs online and apply to them automatically.

## Background

* Problem 1:
Applying to jobs is very time consuming.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

The user will sign up on the website and select from a list of job titles ones that interest the applicant. Then the user will upload their CV and an AI will start applying and writing a cover letter for each job. The user can then log into the service and check what jobs he has applied to so he can excpect who will call the user to interviews.

## Data sources and AI methods

The data will firstly be only used with myworkdayjobs job applications. In addition to this we will apply to get access to GPT-3 in order to write the cover letters.

## Challenges

A challenge is that so many different job portals are used and for some jobs you need to send an e-mail and for some jobs you use linkedin etc.

## What next?

Next we would need programmers to build the app and apply for access to GPT-3.

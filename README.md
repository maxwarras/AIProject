# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

In this project I will make an automatic job application AI, that will help people with no jobs apply to jobs automatically with the help of AI. The AI will analyze the CV of the person and then find jobs online and apply to them automatically by making a cover letter depending on the job description. 


## Background


* Problem 1
Applying to jobs is very time consuming.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

The user will sign up on the website and select from a list of job titles ones that interest the applicant. Then the user will upload their CV and an AI will start applying and writing a cover letter for each job. The user can then log into the service and check what jobs he has applied to so he can excpect who will call the user to interviews.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
